## Data used and model work
Due to error while using using from given API's , custom data has been used that classifies data into 3 different categories
out model can recommend that data


## Deep learning model
Here i made 2 tower NN model, one processing user data and other processing video data taking their dot product should give us the probability of user to like a particular video
Due to time contrainst and some issue faces, i could only run the data on random dummty data
