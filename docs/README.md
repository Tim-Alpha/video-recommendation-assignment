# Video Recommendation Engine Documentation

## Overview
The **Video Recommendation Engine** is a FastAPI-based backend system designed to deliver **personalized motivational and wellness video content** to users. This system dynamically ranks videos based on user engagement, while also providing **cold-start recommendations** for new users who have no prior interaction history.

## Quick Setup

Follow these steps to run the project locally:

1. **Clone the repository**  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shansit007/video-recommendation-assignment.git
cd video-recommendation-assignment

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment**
python -m venv venv
# Windows
venv\Scripts\activate
# macOS/Linux
source venv/bin/activate

3. pip install -r requirements.txt
4. alembic upgrade head
5. uvicorn app.main:app --reload



## Key Features

### 1. Personalized Recommendations
- User interactions (`view`, `like`, `inspire`, `rating`) are tracked.
- Each interaction type has a **weight** that contributes to a video score:
  - `view` = 1  
  - `like` = 3  
  - `inspire` = 4  
  - `rating` = 2  
- Videos are **sorted by score** to deliver a personalized feed.

### 2. Cold-Start Support
- New users receive recommendations based on **mood-category mapping**, even before any interaction.
- Predefined categories:
  - Motivation
  - Wellness
  - Health
  - Focus
- Each category has a set of **curated example videos**, ensuring immediate engagement.

### 3. Category-Based Feed
- Users can fetch videos filtered by category (`project_code` query parameter).
- Combines **cold-start mood-based recommendations** and **interaction-weighted scores**.

### 4. Live FLIC API Integration
- All videos and metadata are fetched live from the FLIC API.
- Ensures up-to-date video content for every user request.

### 5. FastAPI & OpenAPI Integration
- Automatic API documentation available at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs`.
- Supports **Swagger UI** for live testing of endpoints.


## Endpoints

### 1. Personalized Feed
**GET** `/feed/?username=<username>`

**Response Example:**
```json
{
  "username": "John",
  "recommended_videos": [
    {"id": 1, "title": "Motivational Video 1", "category": "Motivation", "score": 4},
    {"id": 2, "title": "Wellness Video", "category": "Wellness", "score": 2}
  ]
}
````

### 2. Category-Based Feed

**GET** `/feed/category?username=<username>&project_code=<category>`

**Response Example:**

```json
{
  "username": "John",
  "category": "Motivation",
  "recommended_videos": [
    {"id": 1, "title": "Motivational Video 1", "score": 4},
    {"id": 2, "title": "Motivational Video 2", "score": 2}
  ]
}
```
## Frontend Integration

We have also added a simple interactive frontend to visualize the personalized and category-based recommendations generated by the backend.

### Running the Frontend

1. Start the backend:

   ```bash
   uvicorn app.main:app --reload
   ```
2. Open the frontend:

   * [http://127.0.0.1:8000/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/) → Loads the interactive frontend
   * [http://127.0.0.1:8000/frontend/index.html](http://127.0.0.1:8000/frontend/index.html) → Alternative route

### ✨ Features of the Frontend

* **Live interaction**: Users can enter their username and instantly fetch personalized recommendations.
* **Category filtering**: Users can select a category (Motivation, Wellness, Health, Focus) and fetch recommendations.
* **Dynamic rendering**: Results displayed in an interactive card layout styled with Tailwind CSS.
* **Seamless integration**: The frontend consumes FastAPI APIs (`/feed/` and `/feed/category`) in real time.

### 🎯 Why Frontend Matters

* Makes the recommendation engine **demo-ready and user-friendly**.
* Stakeholders can see **live recommendations** instead of only Postman results.
* Provides a **professional and interactive look**, useful for presentations or internships.
* Keeps backend logic intact while making the system accessible for non-technical users.

## System Architecture

1. **Database (SQLite/PostgreSQL)**

   * Tables: users, videos, interactions
   * Relationships: User ↔ Interaction ↔ Video

2. **Recommendation Logic**

   * Weighted scoring system based on user interactions.
   * Cold-start fallback using mood-category mapping.

3. **FastAPI Server**

   * Dependency injection for DB sessions.
   * Endpoints serve JSON for Postman or frontend integration.


## Professional Advantages

* Supports instant user engagement with **cold-start logic**.
* Dynamic, interaction-driven **personalized feed**.
* Demo-ready: randomized interactions simulate real app behavior.
* Easy to extend to graph-based or neural network recommendations later.
* Postman Collection fully working, ready to use just need to import & run the backend.

## Future Enhancements

1. Implement **graph neural network** or **embedding-based video similarity**.
2. Add **pagination and caching** for large datasets.
3. Add **user authentication** for secure API access.
