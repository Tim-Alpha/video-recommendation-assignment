# Video Recommendation Algorithm

## Project Overview
This project aims to build a personalized video recommendation system. The system utilizes user interactions (such as views, likes, and ratings) and video metadata (such as categories and tags) to suggest relevant content. The goal is to provide high-quality recommendations while also addressing challenges like cold-start users and trending content.

## Problem Statement
The recommendation system should:
- Personalize video suggestions based on user preferences and past interactions.
- Handle cold-start problems by recommending trending content to new users.
- Include popular or trending videos in the recommendations to maintain relevance.

## Approach

### 1. Data Preprocessing
Data is fetched using APIs to retrieve information about user interactions (views, likes, ratings) and video metadata. The data is preprocessed by:
- Normalizing ratings and engagement scores.
- Handling missing values (e.g., imputation or removal).
- Extracting features from video metadata (e.g., tags, categories).

### 2. Algorithm Development
- **Content-Based Filtering**: Videos similar to those a user has interacted with are recommended based on metadata.
- **Collaborative Filtering**: User-based or item-based collaborative filtering is used to recommend videos based on similar users' preferences.
- **Hybrid Model**: Both content-based and collaborative filtering methods are combined for better accuracy.

### 3. Cold Start Problem Handling
For new users, the system recommends popular or trending videos, as these are likely to appeal to a wide range of users.

### 4. Trending Content
Trending content is identified based on recent popularity and boosted in the recommendation rankings.

## Evaluation Metrics
- **Click-Through Rate (CTR)**: Measures user engagement with recommended videos.
- **Mean Average Precision (MAP)**: Evaluates the ranking of relevant recommendations.

## Code Structure
- `data_preprocessing.py`: Handles data fetching and preprocessing.
- `recommendation_model.py`: Implements the recommendation algorithms.
- `evaluation.py`: Contains functions for evaluating the performance of the model.
- `main.py`: Main script to run the entire process.

## Results and Insights
The model performs well in terms of CTR, with users showing increased engagement with personalized recommendations. The hybrid model improved ranking precision, as measured by MAP.

## Challenges and Solutions
- **Cold-Start Problem**: We addressed this by recommending popular content to new users, ensuring they had relevant videos to watch from the start.
- **Data Imbalance**: To handle data sparsity, we used hybrid models combining collaborative filtering with content-based filtering.
